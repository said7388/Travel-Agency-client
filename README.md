Since tourism is one of the most significant industries in the World, I try to made a travel agency website. I will be using React for the front-end and Node Express for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS and React Bootstrap while the functionality will be added using JSX. I plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom packages available which user can choose according to his preference.

The customer can sign in/sign up with Google for the tour packages. Customers can book easily through the site. And there are other features such as customers can check their Tour Booking, and many more. And They can Create, Manage Packages, Manage bookings. The design is pretty simple and the user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
